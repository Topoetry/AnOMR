# AnOMR
Another Optimus Manager for Runit

Partially unfinished, but functionnal set of shell scripts for managing an optimus laptop (the pure nvidia/discrete gpu is quite broken, I'll certainely fix in a while since I do not use it for now). (And the switch require to be launch from tty)
Depends on runit, bbswitch (and dash, but you might change the shebangs).
